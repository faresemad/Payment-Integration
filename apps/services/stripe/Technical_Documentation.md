# Stripe Invoice Service - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Stripe Invoice Service is a Django-based Python package that provides a clean, modular interface for integrating with Stripe's invoicing system. The implementation follows SOLID principles and uses dependency injection to create a maintainable and testable codebase focused specifically on invoice creation and webhook handling.

## Architecture Design

### Design Principles

The implementation follows the same architectural patterns as the Cryptomus service:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one clear responsibility
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions
3. **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces for specific operations
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: Extensible design without modification

## Component Analysis

### 1. Data Transfer Objects (`dto.py`)

#### Purpose

Handles data structures for invoice creation and line items.

#### Components

**`InvoiceLineItem`**

- Encapsulates individual line item data
- Supports Stripe's price_data structure
- Handles quantity and pricing information

**`InvoiceRequest`**

- Encapsulates complete invoice creation parameters
- Supports customer identification, currency, and metadata
- Handles invoice collection settings and due dates

#### Key Features

- Immutable dataclasses for data integrity
- Flexible line item structure supporting both simple and complex pricing
- Clean serialization methods for Stripe API compatibility

### 2. Abstract Base Classes (`abstracts.py`)

#### Purpose

Defines contracts specifically for invoice and webhook operations.

#### Components

**`SignatureValidator`**

- Defines webhook signature verification interface
- Supports Stripe's specific signature format and timing validation
- Enables different validation strategies

**`HttpClient`**

- Abstracts HTTP layer (though Stripe SDK handles most HTTP operations)
- Maintains consistency with overall architecture
- Enables testing and future flexibility

**`InvoiceProcessor`**

- Defines core invoice operations interface
- Separates business logic from implementation details
- Supports full invoice lifecycle management

**`WebhookValidator`**

- Defines webhook validation interface
- Enables secure webhook processing
- Supports signature verification and payload validation

**`ApiClient`**

- Defines high-level API communication interface
- Abstracts Stripe SDK operations
- Enables testing and error handling consistency

### 3. Concrete Implementations (`implementations.py`)

#### Purpose

Provides Stripe-specific implementations using the official Stripe Python SDK.

#### Components

**`StripeSignatureValidator`**

- Implements Stripe's webhook signature verification
- Handles timestamp validation for replay attack prevention
- Uses HMAC-SHA256 for signature generation and verification

```python
# Stripe Webhook Signature Verification Flow
signature_header -> parse timestamp and signatures -> validate timestamp freshness -> 
generate HMAC-SHA256 -> constant-time comparison -> return validation result
```

**`StripeApiClient`**

- Wraps Stripe SDK operations in consistent interface
- Handles different API endpoints (create, retrieve, sen
